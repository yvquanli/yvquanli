Long-term engagement in **AI for Science** research. Addressing the bottlenecks of high difficulty, high cost, and long cycles in molecular design, I conduct AI-driven de novo design of small molecules, peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids. My research focuses on the "Expert Wisdom + General AI + Specialized AI + Wet Lab Robot" four-in-one collaborative molecular design theory, constructing a full-chain dry-wet closed-loop intelligent molecular design platform, aiming to significantly improve the success rate and efficiency of molecular design. Related work has been published in journals such as [Nature Machine Intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00501-8) and Advanced Science as the lead author. Current research interests include:

- AI Basic Research: Agents and Swarm Intelligence, Molecular Representation Learning and Generative Design
- AI for Science Research: De novo Design of Small Molecules/Peptides/Proteins/Small Nucleic Acids/Materials, Synthesis Planning, Target Discovery, Smart Plant Protection

**Contact**: I look forward to connecting with experts and students to exchange new ideas (WeChat: yvquanli).

**Call for Papers**: Welcome to contact me for submissions to TIDD/Innovation/Exploration/iMeta journals. High-quality manuscripts can be prioritized for review.

[**Recruiting**](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/discovery/item/68f60c6f0000000004013c00): Recruiting Master's/Ph.D. students/Joint Training/Interns. I promise not to steal first authorship, not to be abusive, and not to delay graduation. Introductory training upon enrollment, detailed guidance throughout the process, abundant diverse computing resources. I help every student produce a first-author Q1/A-conference paper, and fully support excellent students in publishing in sub-journals.
